puts "goo goo ga ga heres a basic calc that functions like it was written from a little kid using python"
sleep(1)
puts "Enter a number: "
Num1 = gets.chomp
puts "Enter a operator: "
Operator = gets.chomp
puts "Enter another number: "
Num2 = gets.chomp
operator.downcase # this is harder than i thought :D

if Operator == "add"
    puts "help"
end
